git remote add [shortname] [url] = creates new Git repository
git remote -v = view strings
git push origin master = push your master branch to git
git pull origin master = pull your master branch from git

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working with a group of people on one code. You can all have access to the code to suggest changes, or work on your own individual parts.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To avoid Git pulling when you're working on something and haven't committed/pushed it yet.
